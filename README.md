My configs for my linux system

## Applications and information

### Operating system

I use Ubuntu 24.10, although these configurations should work with all versions of linux that can run these applications

### Window Manager
#### Hyprland

I use Hyprland as my window manager. It is fast, highly customizable and does not sacrafice looks for having tiling capabilities. On its own, it is very bare but with a little configuring and adding in some other apps designed for it, you get a desktop enviroment that is tailored directly to how you want it. See the official wiki for more information. (https://wiki.hyprland.org/)

### Task Bar 
#### Waybar

Hyprland does not have a taskbar built in by default, so users need to configure one if they want one. The task bar allows the user to see many system stats such as resource usage, network status etc. There are multiple taskbars availible for Hyprland, depending on your operating system. I chose to use Waybar, becuase it is built specifically for hyprland and is known for being extremely customizable. My friend, Niko (NMdevesky) sent me his configuration for it after I tried (and failed) to make my own.

### Terminal Emulator
#### Kitty/Alacritty

I wanted something customizable and fast, so there were a few options availible to me. Currently, I am using kitty, which is the reccommended emulator for hyprland. It is very fast and very customizable. Prior to using kitty, I used Alacritty. My config for that is also here. I would also reccommend you check out gnome terminal. It is probably the easiest to configure, in  my opinion.

### Application launcher
#### Tofi (Rofi Fork)

I decided to use tofi becuase it is clean, easy to configure and was the easiest to set up for me

### Text Editor
#### Neovim

I wanted to move more into TUIs (terminal user interfaces), instead of GUIs (Graphical user interfaces). Originally, I used nano, but it was not clean looking at all and it did not work as a full fletched IDE/code editor. Next, I used Vim, but it had the same problems. A few months ago, my friend Niko (NMedvesky on GitHub) sent me his Neovim configuration and helped me set it up on my system. It looks pretty clean and in the future, I will edit it more.
